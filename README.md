# Flutter (software)

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

The first version of Flutter was known by the codename "Sky" and ran on the Android operating system. It was unveiled at the 2015 Dart developer summit with the stated intent of being able to render consistently at 120 frames per second. During the keynote of Google Developer Days in Shanghai in September 2018, Google announced Flutter Release Preview 2, which is the last big release before Flutter 1.0. On December 4th of that year, Flutter 1.0 was released at the Flutter Live event, denoting the first "stable" version of the Framework. On December 11, 2019, Flutter 1.12 was released at the Flutter Interactive event.

On May 6, 2020, the Dart software development kit (SDK) in version 2.8 and the Flutter in version 1.17.0 were released, where support was added to the Metal API, improving performance on iOS devices (approximately 50%), new Material widgets, and new network tracking.

On March 3, 2021, Google released Flutter 2 during an online Flutter Engage event. This major update brought official support for web-based applications with new CanvasKit renderer and web specific widgets, early-access desktop application support for Windows, macOS, and Linux and improved Add-to-App APIs. This release included sound null-safety, which caused many breaking changes and issues with many external packages, but the Flutter team included instructions to mitigate these changes as well.

On September 8th, 2021, the Dart SDK in version 2.14 and Flutter version 2.5 were released by Google. The update brought improvements to the Android Full-Screen mode and the latest version of Google's Material Design called Material You. Dart received two new updates, the newest lint conditions have been standardized and preset as the default conditions as well Dart for Apple Silicon is now stable.
